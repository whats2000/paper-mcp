Built for external agent clients (Claude Cowork, Claude Desktop, Cursor, any MCP framework). It supplies what those clients lack — paper acquisition and faithful extraction — and nothing else: **no accounts, no stored user data, no server-side LLM calls, and no agent flows.**

This is *data-processing functionality*, not an agent. Pipelines built on top — slides, summaries, literature reviews — belong to the calling agent and its own skills. This service's only job is to make each step precise.

## 🧰 The tools

| Tool | What it does | Network scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `search_arxiv` | Search arXiv by relevance. Metadata only — nothing is downloaded | `arxiv.org` |
| `search_papers` | Search Semantic Scholar's full corpus — broader than arXiv, with venues and citation counts | `api.semanticscholar.org` |
| `find_related` | Citations, references, or recommendations for a paper | `api.semanticscholar.org` |
| `resolve_paper` | Turn an arXiv id, DOI, `ss:` id, or a free-text title into one normalized reference — and say where an open-access copy lives | arXiv · S2 · Unpaywall |
| **`fetch_paper`** | **The product.** PDF → markdown + figure index, content-addressed and cached. Returns a job handle while the GPU works | arXiv + Marker |
| `get_job` | Poll an extraction | — |
| `compile_latex` | Compile caller-supplied LaTeX in a jail and return structured errors. A **tool, not a flow** — it never loops, revises, or authors | none (denied in-jail) |

## 📦 What you get

`fetch_paper("arxiv:1706.03762")` returns the paper as markdown —

```markdown
## Introduction

The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent…

| Model | BLEU |
| --- | --- |
| Base | 27.3 |
| Big  | 28.4 |

$$
\mathrm{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \mathrm{softmax}(QK^T/\sqrt{d_k})V
$$

![fig-001](figures/fig-001.png)

*fig-001: The Transformer architecture.*
```

— alongside the figure index:

```jsonc
"figures": [
  { "id": "fig-001",
    "caption": "The Transformer architecture.",
    "page": 3,
    "image_url": "https://…/a/<token>/figures/fig-001.png" }
]
```

Extraction is **Marker**, and only Marker. Three guarantees, each asserted by tests and by a real-workflow check:

- **Tables stay tables** — rows and columns intact. A table flattened to a blob of cell text invites an agent to read numbers against the wrong column.
- **Equations stay LaTeX** — never prose approximations of maths.
- **Figures are extracted, indexed and captioned** — an index entry exists only when the image really decoded to disk, so citing `fig-001` always refers to something real.

There is no low-fidelity fallback engine. PaperHub shipped crude PyMuPDF extraction once, measured the output as "conference-UNusable", and replaced it with Marker; a service whose value is faithful extraction must not quietly substitute unfaithful extraction. Without Marker, a PDF fetch reports `extraction_unavailable` rather than degrading.

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/whats2000/paper-mcp.git
cd paper-mcp

docker compose up -d --build      # paper-mcp on :8000, Marker on :8002
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

The first build downloads TeX Live and ~2 GB of Surya weights; both persist in named volumes, so a rebuild never re-pays for them.

> [!NOTE]
> **GPU strongly recommended.** Marker runs on CPU but far too slowly to be useful. `MARKER_MAX_PAGES=1` bounds VRAM per call — VRAM scales with page *content density*, not page count, and one dense two-column page can saturate 6 GB. Raise it only on a bigger GPU.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The default `AUTH_MODE=open` means **every caller is unauthenticated**. Before exposing this anywhere, set the OIDC variables and your own hostname in `PAPER_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` — see [Configuration](#️-configuration).

## 🔌 Connecting a client

The service speaks Streamable HTTP at `/mcp`. A local Claude Code session connects with an `.mcp.json` pointing at your own instance:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paper-mcp": { "type": "http", "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp" }
  }
}
```

Against a deployment with `AUTH_MODE=oidc`, the client sends a bearer token from your IdP on **every** request — there is no session to authenticate once and reuse:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paper-mcp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://paper-mcp.example.org/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${PAPER_MCP_TOKEN}" }
    }
  }
}
```

```

**Nothing per-user is stored.** Artifacts are keyed by content, not by caller: two people asking for the same public paper share one entry, which is deduplication of public data rather than a leak. Identity exists only as a salted hash used to meter quota. That is the security architecture, not an omission — a shared public endpoint with no per-user state has nothing to leak between callers.

Full architecture lives in the [SRS](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-11-paper-mcp-srs.md).

## 🛡️ Security

The service is internet-facing and executes caller-supplied LaTeX, so the controls are verified against a **running container** rather than a test client. That distinction is not pedantry: `TestClient` follows redirects, and that is exactly how a `307` on `POST /mcp` passed the suite while a connector would have broken on it. A property that only holds in-process is a property of a stack nobody is attacking.

The attack surface exercised, against a real IdP:

| Class | Covered |
| --- | --- |
| **Token** | missing · malformed · expired · wrong audience (confused deputy) · wrong issuer · unknown signing key |
| **Forgery** | **`alg=none` signature stripping** · **RS256→HS256 key confusion** — the two a header-trusting verifier accepts |
| **Oracle** | rejection bodies are byte-identical, so a probe cannot learn *which* check failed |
| **Transport** | DNS rebinding via `Host` (`421`) · no redirect on `POST /mcp` |
| **Artifacts** | six traversal encodings — plain, url-encoded, double-encoded, backslash, absolute, unknown token |
| **Abuse** | quota exhaustion answering `429` with `Retry-After` |
| **Sandbox** | shell escape · absolute-path read · escaping asset path, driven through the real `compile_latex` inside the jail |

All 26 defended. Two rules that made the result trustworthy, both learned the hard way:

1. **Attack the image you ship, and confirm the *installed* package carries the controls first.** One run reported a total auth bypass that did not exist in the code — the image predated the middleware.
2. **Prove the guards don't break the product.** A service that rejects everyone is trivially secure and useless, so the whole flow is also driven through a real MCP client bearing a real token — resolve → extraction → compiled deck — confirming that **no session identifier is ever issued**: the server is `stateless_http`, so there is no handle to leak, and every request carries its own credential.

### Compiling LaTeX

`compile_latex` executes caller-supplied source, so it runs behind three layers: TeX flags (`-no-shell-escape`, `openin_any=p`, `openout_any=p`), **nsjail**, and wall-clock/output caps. One attempt, structured errors with file and line, no revise loop — the calling agent fixes and resubmits.

**Without a sandbox it refuses.** nsjail is Linux-only, so on a host lacking it the tool returns `sandbox_unavailable` unless `PAPER_MCP_AUTH_MODE=open`. Declining costs a caller one retry; running a stranger's program unisolated costs the host.

The container needs `seccomp=unconfined` (already in `docker-compose.yml`): Docker's default profile blocks the namespace `clone()` nsjail requires, and without it every compile fails to launch. Measured — `SYS_ADMIN` and `--privileged` are *not* needed, which keeps the exemption narrow.

```bash
# the release gate: adversarial corpus inside the jail
docker run --rm --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
  -v "$PWD/scripts:/app/scripts:ro" paper-mcp \
  python /app/scripts/sandbox_corpus.py
```

Ten cases locally and nine in-jail, each failing closed: shell escape does not execute, absolute-path and traversal reads are refused, writes outside the job directory are refused, unbounded expansion is killed, no network is reachable from inside the jail — and a benign document still compiles.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Environment only (twelve-factor). Nothing is read from a config file.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PAPER_MCP_HOST` / `PAPER_MCP_PORT` | `0.0.0.0` / `8000` | Bind address |
| `PAPER_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | localhost only | **DNS-rebinding protection.** A public deployment must list its own hostname or every request gets `421`. `*` disables the check and is warned about at boot |
| `PAPER_MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | derived from allowed hosts | CORS origins for browser clients |
| `PAPER_MCP_AUTH_MODE` | `open` | `open` disables authentication — development only. Anything else requires the OIDC settings below |
| `PAPER_MCP_OIDC_ISSUER` / `PAPER_MCP_OIDC_AUDIENCE` | unset | The IdP to validate bearer tokens against. This service is a resource server: it never issues tokens |
| `PAPER_MCP_SUBJECT_SALT` | per-process | Salt for the HMAC of `sub` used in metering and logs. The raw subject is never logged |
| `PAPER_MCP_QUOTA_CALLS_PER_MINUTE` | `60` | Per-caller call budget |
| `PAPER_MCP_QUOTA_EXTRACTIONS_PER_HOUR` | `20` | Per-caller GPU-extraction budget |
| `PAPER_MCP_QUOTA_COMPILE_SECONDS_PER_HOUR` | `600` | Per-caller compile budget, metered by time spent |
| `PAPER_MCP_UNPAYWALL_EMAIL` | unset | Contact email enabling Unpaywall open-access lookup in `resolve_paper` |
| `PAPER_MCP_S2_API_KEY` | unset | **Effectively required in production** — see below |
| `PAPER_MCP_MARKER_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8002` | Marker service. **Required for extraction** — without it `fetch_paper` reports the dependency rather than degrading |
| `PAPER_MCP_MARKER_MAX_PAGES` | `1` | Pages per Marker call. VRAM scales with page *content density*, not page count: one dense two-column page can saturate 6 GB, and a 5-page batch was measured at 21 minutes. Raise only on a bigger GPU |
| `MARKER_GEMINI_MODEL` | `gemini-2.5-flash` | *(on the Marker service)* Model backing Marker's `use_llm` accuracy pass. marker-pdf carries its own default and Google has already retired it once — every call answered 404 while Marker returned `200`, so the pass stopped running with nothing to show for it. Pin it here when Google moves again |
| `PAPER_MCP_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8000` | Origin the artifact URLs are built from. Nothing is persisted with it — URLs are derived on every serve, so moving hosts does not strand a warm cache |
| `PAPER_MCP_ARTIFACT_ROOT` | `artifacts` | Content-addressed cache for bundles and figure images |
| `PAPER_MCP_ARTIFACT_TTL_HOURS` | `24` | How long artifacts survive before the sweeper reclaims them |
| `PAPER_MCP_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Log level, applied to uvicorn too. `WARNING` drops per-request access logging: measured 18,222 → 114 bytes over 300 requests. Worth setting for a public deployment — a server whose stdout backs up blocks inside `write()`, and per-request logging is what fills the buffer |

### Semantic Scholar needs an API key

Measured on-device against the live API: the keyless tier throttles the **search** endpoint so hard it is unusable. A single `search_papers` call still returned HTTP 429 after **237 seconds** of paced retries, and a title lookup after **873 seconds**. Single-paper lookups (`/paper/{id}` by arXiv id, DOI, or S2 id) and the citation-graph endpoints answered fine throughout.

So without `PAPER_MCP_S2_API_KEY`:

| Works | Unreliable |
| --- | --- |
| `search_arxiv` (different upstream) | `search_papers` |
| `resolve_paper` by arXiv id / DOI / `ss:` id | `resolve_paper` by free-text title |
| `find_related` (all three modes) | |

Callers get a typed `rate_limited` error carrying `retry_after`, never a hang or a silently empty result — but the capability is degraded. Get a key at <https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api>.

## 🎓 Skills

Two starting-point skills ship in `skills/`, also served over `prompts/` so a Claude client surfaces them as slash commands:

| Skill | Shows an agent how to |
| --- | --- |
| `paper-to-deck` | build a Beamer deck grounded in figures the paper actually contains |
| `deep-read` | answer questions from the bundle rather than from memory of the paper |

They are **examples, not the product.** The calling agent owns its pipelines and can ignore them entirely — which is exactly why this service ships tools rather than flows.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Development

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest                    # 199 tests, fast and offline (integration excluded)
uv run pytest -m integration     # spawns a real server, drives it with a real MCP client
uv run ruff check src tests
uv run mypy src                  # --strict

docker compose up -d marker      # required for extraction
uv run paper-mcp
```

The interpreter is pinned in `.python-version` (3.13) so every contributor and the container build agree on one runtime (NFR-07).

**pytest proves the code runs; it cannot prove the product works.** Mocked tests are blind to upstream contracts by construction, so two on-device checks are load-bearing:

```bash
uv run python scripts/on_device_check.py                 # every tool, every externally-dependent branch
uv run python scripts/paper_workflow_check.py 1706.03762 # the real workflow, judged on content
```

The first boots the service through its real entry point and drives it with a real MCP client over the wire. A throttled upstream is reported `skip`, never `pass` — a check that cannot reach its branch has not verified it.

The second judges the *output*: does the markdown have tables with separator rows, equations as LaTeX, a populated and captioned figure index, and figure URLs that download real image bytes? Slow by nature — Marker takes roughly a minute per dense page.

Between them these have caught defects the unit suite passed clean: a `307` redirect on `POST /mcp` (the in-process test client follows redirects), a Semantic Scholar field name one endpoint accepts and another rejects, a `similar` mode pointed at an endpoint that does not exist, a synchronous arXiv client blocking the event loop (three concurrent calls: 20.5 s → 0.7 s once threaded), and a bundle that persisted absolute artifact URLs — so a warm cache surviving a redeploy handed out figure links to an origin that no longer answered.

<details>
<summary><b>If uv warns <code>VIRTUAL_ENV=… does not match the project environment path .venv</code> →</b></summary>

<br>

That warning — and an editor reporting this project's dependencies as "not installed" — have one cause: **VS Code's selected Python interpreter.**

The Python extension exports the selected interpreter as `VIRTUAL_ENV` into its terminals and into extension-spawned processes (which is how Claude Code's shells inherit it). If that interpreter is a *bare* Python install rather than a virtualenv — a uv-managed `…/uv/python/cpython-3.x…/python.exe`, say, which has no `pyvenv.cfg` — then uv correctly refuses it and Pylance resolves against an interpreter lacking this project's packages.

`.vscode/settings.json` fixes it for this repo by pointing `python.defaultInterpreterPath` at `${workspaceFolder}/.venv`; **reload the window** for it to take effect. To fix it everywhere, repoint the user-level `python.defaultInterpreterPath` in your VS Code settings.

Things that do **not** fix it, tested: pinning `.python-version` (it selects an interpreter; the warning compares environment *paths*), and `UV_NO_ACTIVE=1`. There is no `pyproject.toml` or `uv.toml` key for it. The ad-hoc escape is `uv run --no-active …` — a real flag, though `uv run --help` documents only its `--active` counterpart.

## 🧬 Provenance

The extraction and LaTeX pipelines are ported from the [PaperHub](https://github.com/whats2000/PaperHub) proof-of-concept, which validated the end-to-end flow inside a single-user local application. PaperHub proved the *pipeline*; it could not be the *product*, because the delivery target is a remote, multi-user, internet-facing service that executes untrusted input.

Every ported file carries a header naming its source and what was adapted. The dependency arrow points one way — this project imports nothing from PaperHub.
