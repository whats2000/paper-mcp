"""Turn Marker blocks into the two things an agent needs: markdown + figures.

This is the whole product. Everything downstream of it — slides, summaries,
literature reviews — is a pipeline the calling agent builds from skills. This
service supplies data, so the only question that matters here is whether the
data is faithful.

Faithful means, concretely:

* tables stay tables (rows and columns), never a blob of cell text
* equations stay LaTeX, never prose approximations of maths
* figures are extracted, indexed, and captioned, never invented

# Block shapes ported from PaperHub `pipelines/marker_to_asset.py` @ fd65834.
# Adapted: emits one markdown document plus a figure index rather than
# PaperHub's PaperAsset, and renders tables through `html_table_to_markdown`
# instead of flattening them.
