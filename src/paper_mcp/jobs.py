"""Background jobs for work that cannot fit in a tool call.

Marker is slow by nature — PaperHub measured 21 minutes for a 5-page dense
batch — so a PDF extraction cannot be an inline tool call. It would exceed any
MCP client's request timeout, and the caller would get a dropped connection
instead of an answer (a failure this project has already paid for once).

Two properties matter beyond "run it later":

* **Coalescing by content key.** Two callers asking for the same uncached
  paper join one job. Without this, N callers start N GPU extractions of the
  same PDF and starve each other.
* **Serialized execution.** Marker work runs one at a time. VRAM scales with
  page content density, and on a 6 GB card concurrency means OOM rather than
  throughput.

Jobs are in-memory and ephemeral. A restart forgets outstanding handles, which
is survivable precisely because results are content-addressed: calling
`fetch_paper` again returns the finished bundle from cache rather than
recomputing it.
