"""`extract_pdf` and `get_job` — turning a caller's PDF into usable data.

A cache hit returns the bundle immediately. A miss starts a background job,
because Marker takes minutes on a dense paper and holding an MCP request open
that long gets the connection dropped rather than answered.

The caller supplies the bytes (SRS v1.0). Nothing here reaches the network:
acquiring a paper is the calling agent's job, and it already has better ways
to do it than this service had.
