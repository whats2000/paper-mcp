"""The bundle — a paper an LLM agent can use immediately.

Two things, because two things are what an agent actually needs:

* `markdown` — the paper as readable text, with real tables and equations as
  LaTeX. Marker produces it; nothing here re-derives or "improves" it.
* `figures` — the figure index: an id, a caption, and a URL that resolves to
  the extracted image.

Deliberately not here: a section index, an equation index, and an
outline/full duality. Marker emits `##` headings, so an agent navigates the
markdown itself; it inlines equations as LaTeX, so a parallel index would be
a second copy to keep honest. PaperHub needed those because it drove a
citation canvas over character offsets. This service does not.
